Program Features
*Basic Implementation - Ship can fly around and shoot. Shooting spawns a bullet stored in an array of Bullets. There is a delay between each shot. Asteroids randomly float around given random velocitys derived from random angles. Shooting an asteroid destroys the asteroid and spawns two smaller asteroids in its place.Spawned asteroids have a short spawn protection.

Asteroid bullet collisions and asteroid ship collisions use a test which sees if a point is in a circle using the distance formula. 

Asteroids and ship wraps position if they go out of bounds. 

*Extra Features
-Not implemented
